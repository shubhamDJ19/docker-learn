Queries How are babies created?
Answers (Msg 1): Every month, the ovaries release an egg and send it to the uterus. During vaginal sex, the sperm (from the penis) enters the vagina and travels to the cervix and uterus.

If the sperm and egg meet, then fertilization occurs, which means the egg starts to prepare to become a foetus.

If this fertilized egg sticks to the uterus, then it means one is pregnant. 
Answers (Msg 2): To understand how babies are conceived, it is important to understand the below 3 terms:

1. Conception: In order to conceive a baby a sperm (male reproductive cell) must fertilise an egg (female reproductive cell). Conception is the successful joining of an egg and sperm. This process can occur in the hours to days after having sexual intercourse. 

2. Fertilisation: When the sperm meets an egg, the egg gets fertilized. This fertilized egg then develops into an embryo, which implants in the womb (uterus) and subsequently develops into a foetus and eventually a baby. 

3. Implantation: After about 7 days, the fertilized egg  attaches itself to the lining of the uterus days and starts to grow and develop into an embryo. This marks the beginning of pregnancy.

KeyWords: What is ovulation?
Queries What is ovulation?
Answers (Msg 1): Ovulation is a process in which a mature egg is released from ovary and travels down the fallopian tube where it can potentially be fertilized by sperm. 

During the first 14 days of the menstrual cycle, an egg matures in the ovaries. Around day 14 of the cycle, the egg is ready for release and emerges from the ovary. After release, the egg has about a 12-24 hour window where it can be fertilized by a sperm.
Answers (Msg 2): Sperm may survive in a female's genital tract and be capable of fertilizing an egg for up to five days after intercourse. If a sperm penetrates the egg, an embryo will begin to form.

Ovulation is a key part of the reproductive system and is necessary for conception to occur.

KeyWords: Getting pregnant with twins
Queries How do people get twins?
Answers (Msg 1): There are 2 ways that twins can happen. Identical twins are made when 1 already-fertilized egg splits into 2 separate embryos. 

Because identical twins come from the same sperm and egg, they have the same genetic material (DNA) and look exactly alike.
Answers (Msg 2): Non-identical twins (also called “fraternal” twins), are made when two separate eggs are fertilized by two separate sperm, and both fertilized eggs implant in the uterus. 

This can happen if the ovaries release more than one egg naturally, or during certain kinds of fertility treatments. Non-identical twins have completely different genetic material (DNA), and usually don't look alike. They're the most common type of twin.

KeyWords: Early Indicators of pregnancy
Queries What are common symptoms of pregnancy?
Answers (Msg 1): The most common indicators of pregnancy are:

- A missed period: The most common and obvious sign. But missing a period isn't always a sign of pregnancy. Periods can also be missed due to stress, excessive exercise, dieting, hormone imbalances and other factors.

- Frequent trips to the bathroom: Before even missing a period, peeing may be more often both due to a growing uterus and increased blood supply.

- Fatigue: Many people feel extremely tired in early pregnancy.

- Morning (and noon and night) sickness: Nausea can happen as early as two weeks into a pregnancy. Not everyone experiences nausea and there are various levels of nausea. 

- Sore (and swollen) breasts: Breasts can become tender to the touch. The soreness may be similar to the way breasts feel before a period, only more so. 
Answers (Msg 2): Remember, the only way to know for sure that about being pregnant is to take a pregnancy test or go to a healthcare provider. Pregnancy tests are available at the local pharmacists.

Some people get these symptoms within a few days of conception, while other people don't feel pregnant for weeks. Pregnancy symptoms vary between people and even between pregnancies. If a period is missed, it's important to take a pregnancy test or consult a doctor.

Queries What is a pregnancy test?
Answers (Msg 1): The first (and easiest) way to determine if one is pregnant is to take an at-home pregnancy test. These products are quick, accurate, and readily accessible. These products are available at local medical stores without prescription. 

The test should be done few days after a missed period. That's because home pregnancy tests measure the level of pregnancy hormone hCG in the urine. Also, before a missed period one may not have enough hCG for the test to pick up.
Answers (Msg 2): A negative home pregnancy test also doesn't guarantee negative pregnancy. One could get a false negative by taking the test too early, using diluted urine, or not following the directions. 

If there is doubt about being pregnant, take another one the following week.

The most accurate way to know if one is pregnant, is to go to a healthcare centre to get a blood test and consult a healthcare provider like ASHA, ANM or doctor

Queries How to confirm my pregnancy at home?
Answers (Msg 1): The first (and easiest) way to determine if one is pregnant is to take an at-home pregnancy test. These products are quick, accurate, and readily accessible. These products are available at local medical stores without prescription. 

The test should be done few days after a missed period. That's because home pregnancy tests measure the level of pregnancy hormone hCG in the urine. Also, before a missed period one may not have enough hCG for the test to pick up.

Queries What are the stages of pregnancy?
Answers (Msg 1): The first trimester of pregnancy refers to the first three months of pregnancy (12 weeks). During this period, the foetus's development begins. The foetus is typically around 2.5 to 3.5 inches long (crown to rump) and weighs about 15-30 gms.

Early in the first trimester, the foetus’s heart is starting to beat, and the brain, stomach and intestines are developing. There are little bumps known as 'buds' where arms and legs are starting to grow.

For some, the first trimester is characterised by nausea - often called ‘morning sickness’, although it can occur at any time of day. 
Answers (Msg 2): While some may have food cravings, others experience food aversions, and some have no change in appetite at all.

Other changes in the first trimester include changes in breasts as they become tender, larger and heavier

Some may also feel the need to urinate more often. This happens because the the growing uterus puts pressure on the bladder.

Queries What happens during the first trimester doctor visit?
Answers (Msg 1): 
First trimester health checks usually happen every 4 to 6 weeks, but this can vary, based on the health of the mother and how the foetus develops.

During this stage of the pregnany, many are offered an ultrasound scan at around 12 weeks – where the foetus’s heartbeat is heard during this scan. This ultrasound will also show if there are multiple births (e.g. twins) and can help estimate the foetus’s size and due date, as well as check for some health conditions.
Answers (Msg 2): Other health checks during the first trimester include:

- urine tests to detect urinary infections, a common but manageable condition that if left untreated can trigger preterm labour

- blood tests to check blood type (particularly Rh status), iron levels, blood sugars (for gestational diabetes), rubella (German measles) immunity, and - other infections such as HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis

- general maternal health and wellbeing checks, including a discussion of concerns one might have about their pregnancy or general health, and a medication review (including natural or alternative medicines) to check for safety during pregnancy

Queries What happens in the 4th/ 5th/ 6th month of pregnancy?
Answers (Msg 1): The second trimester represents the middle part of pregnancy  – 4th, 5th and 6th month ( weeks 13 to 26). For many women, one of the best things about this trimester is that nausea might begin to settle.

During the second trimester, the foetus will grow from around 7.5cm, and weighing 30 grams in week 13, to around 23cm and 820 grams at week 26.
Answers (Msg 2): The foetus will be able to move freely within the amniotic sac - a sac that contains and protects a foetus in the uterus. By about week 19 (or sooner if this isn't the first pregnancy), the movement of the foetus may be felt – as a faint tickling or fluttering. 

During these 3 months, the foetus’s organs will continue to develop and the liver, pancreas and kidneys all start to function. During this time, the foetus starts to look like a baby. This is also the time when the foetus might start to suck their thumb. 

By week 20 the foetus can hear sounds, including the sound of mother's heartbeat, and they are learning to recognise the mother's voice, although the ears are not yet fully formed.

During these 3 months, the foetus’s organs will continue to develop and the liver, pancreas and kidneys all start to function. During this time, the foetus starts to look like a baby. This is also the time when the foetus might start to suck their thumb. 

By week 20 the foetus can hear sounds, including the sound of mother's heartbeat, and they are learning to recognise the mother's voice, although the ears are not yet fully formed.

Queries What should I do to maintain my health during the second trimester?
Answers (Msg 1): Eating well and staying active is as important as ever during pregnancy - it's good for the mother's physical and emotional health, and good for the foetus too. 

Light-to-moderate exercise in pregnancy is usually safe: consider walking, swimming, yoga and stationary cycling in the second trimester. 

High-impact exercise and activities where there is a risk of falling, getting hurt (especially around the stomach) or overheating are not recommended such as lifting heavy weight, climbing ladders and stools etc.
Answers (Msg 2): The choice of food during pregnancy is also important – but that doesn't mean ‘eating for two’. It means eating nutrient rich food.

What one eats during pregnancy has been shown to affect how the foetus grows as well as the foetus’s health later in life.

Answers (Msg 1): The last three months starting from 7th month marks the third and final trimester of pregnancy (28-40 weeks). While this trimester could end at the 9th month (week 40) in reality it ends whenever the baby is born.

A baby born before week 37 is considered premature, and if the baby has not been born by week 42, labour may be induced. Labour induction means to stimulate childbirth or delivery through medical treatment. 
Answers (Msg 2): During the third trimester, the foetus continues to grow in size and weight. The lungs are still maturing, and the foetus begins to position itself head down. By the end of the third trimester, the foetus is about 19 to 21 inches long and weighs, on average, 2.5 - 4 kgs. 

During the third trimester, the foetus will develop its senses of seeing and hearing, the brain will continue to develop and the kidneys and lungs will continue to mature. The head will usually turn downward during the last couple of weeks of pregnancy.

Queries What are the symptoms in the third trimester/ last three months of pregnancy?
Answers (Msg 1): Here are some things that will be noticed while getting closer to the time the foetus will be born: 

- The mother's skin and ligaments continue to stretch to accommodate the growing foetus.

- The mother will get tired easily, and sleeping becomes more difficult.

- The mother will experience heartburn and/or breathlessness, as the foetus grows in the abdomen.
Answers (Msg 2): While these are all part of a normal pregnancy, steps can be taken to minimise discomfort. 

Speak with the doctor or ASHA for suggestions, particularly if in pain. 

In the last few weeks of this trimester the body begins to prepare for the coming labour. 

The cervix starts to soften and thin out in preparation for labor and delivery. As this happens, the mucus plug that has been sealing the cervix can come loose and be expelled from the vagina. This is commonly referred to as the "show."

The show is an early sign that the cervix is starting to open up and labor may begin soon. It is often a bloody or brownish discharge that can be accompanied by mild cramping.

Answers (Msg 1): Here are some things that will be noticed while getting closer to the time the foetus will be born: 

- The mother's skin and ligaments continue to stretch to accommodate the growing foetus.

- The mother will get tired easily, and sleeping becomes more difficult.

- The mother will experience heartburn and/or breathlessness, as the foetus grows in the abdomen.
Answers (Msg 2): While these are all part of a normal pregnancy, steps can be taken to minimise discomfort. 

Speak with the doctor or ASHA for suggestions, particularly if in pain. 

In the last few weeks of this trimester the body begins to prepare for the coming labour. 

The cervix starts to soften and thin out in preparation for labor and delivery. As this happens, the mucus plug that has been sealing the cervix can come loose and be expelled from the vagina. This is commonly referred to as the "show."

The show is an early sign that the cervix is starting to open up and labor may begin soon. It is often a bloody or brownish discharge that can be accompanied by mild cramping.

Queries What are the causes of miscarriage?
Answers (Msg 1): It can be difficult to know exactly why a miscarriage happened, but it’s almost never caused by something the pregnant person did. 

Normal activities like sex, exercise, working, and taking most medicines do NOT cause a miscarriage. Minor injuries, like falling, don’t generally cause a miscarriage either.
Answers (Msg 2): Some things that are known to cause miscarriages include:

1. When the fertilized egg has an abnormal number of chromosomes (genes). This happens at random, so it can't be prevented or caused to happen. The chances of this to happen is more in those above 35 years of age.

2. Certain illnesses, like severe diabetes, can increase the chances of a miscarriage.

3. A very serious infection or a major injury may cause miscarriage.

4. Late miscarriages — after 3 months — may be caused by abnormalities in the uterus.

5. If one has had more than 2 miscarriages in a row, they are more likely to have a miscarriage.

Queries What are the types of miscarriages?
Answers (Msg 1): There are several types of miscarriages:

1. Threatened miscarriage — There is vaginal bleeding and have mild cramps, but the cervix stays closed. Half of the time, the bleeding stops and the pregnancy goes on normally. The other half of threatened miscarriages become inevitable miscarriages, and end in pregnancy loss.

2. Inevitable miscarriage — There is an increase in bleeding, and the cervix opens. If this happens, there’s no chance for the pregnancy to continue.
Answers (Msg 2): 
3. Incomplete miscarriage — Some of the pregnancy tissue comes out of the uterus, and some stays inside.  Follow-up treatment may be needed to remove the remaining tissue.

4. Complete miscarriage — All the pregnancy tissue comes out of the uterus. Bleeding and pain subsides. Usually, no extra treatment is needed. 

5. Missed miscarriage — There are no cramps or bleeding. But ultrasound shows an embryo without a heartbeat or an empty pregnancy sac without an embryo. Usually the tissue passes on its own, but treatment may be needed.
